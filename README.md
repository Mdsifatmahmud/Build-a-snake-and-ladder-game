# Build-a-snake-and-ladder-game
The project aims to develop a Snake and Ladder game using the C programming language. Snake and Ladder is a classic board game. Players roll a dice and move their tokens accordingly. If a player lands on a ladder, they advance to a higher position, but if they land on a snake, they slide down. The goal is to reach the final square first.
